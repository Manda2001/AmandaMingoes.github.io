	  As a child growing up I always thought I was the extraverted type, I was always interacting with my peers , was alwasy the first to start a conversation
	  but as I got older I've come to learnt that im very Intorverted. I went on a retreat once and they made us take a personality quiz and after completing the 
	  quiz I found out I was Introverted.After taking the quiz I realized i was definitely an introvert. I love to interact with others, but I don't like when persons 
	  are in my space.I like my alone time yet I dont like to feel alone. I get annoyed when someone talks to me for too long.

	   I took a online personality test on keirsey.com and my results showed that I am a Guardian. Under the characteristics of Guardian I can see where a lot of them 
	   related to me,<br/> I am humble, I am dependable, hard-working, a stabilizing leader I must say this personality test was very valid. Some questions could have been
	   asked better but apart from that <br/>it got me to the tee. If you would like to do the quiz yourself you may click the link
