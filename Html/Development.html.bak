	    I have definitley been devoloping these strengths. I am a natural born leader, I am the first born for my parents, so I always have to lead by examples for 
		my brothers.In Highschool I ran for leadership positions, to be the form leader or even the assistant form leader. I was presidents for clubs, Key club, 
		Catholic Club and Six Form association. I was even apart of my schools leadership team, I was in charge of the set of sixth formers assigned to second form.
		And currently I am the president of a movement know as Catholic Youth Movements. Each oportunity I get I always try to build on my leadership qualities. In 
		addition to that I have always motivated others to be the best they can be. I believe if im excelling my peers should too, that's what friends are for.
		I always like to motivate others, because I myself know how good it feels to be motivated and also how it feels to have none. So in anyway I can I always try 
		to motivate my peers. Lastly I am calm, and collected. Im not one to just let things bother me like that. At first it wasn't easy but I have very much worked 
		on it and I must say I would give myself a pat on the back.

	  <u>The Twelve Pillars</u>
	  <br/> In chapter 4 it spoke about ways in which we can achieve our goals and ways in which we can set them. The chapter stated that it's good to make notes
	  of things you want to achieve <br/>in your life, so that you can work towards meeting a goal in the future.Failure to take notes of what you want to achieve may 
	  lead in lack of focus, and side tracking from what it is <br/>that you want to achieve.It is also good to set different type of goals , whether it be long or short 
	  term goals. You may start out with the short term goal and take baby steps in achieving <br/>the long term goal the true goal you wnat to achieve. Use the short
	  term goals as setting to stones for the bigger picture.I can apply this to my school life, like setting short term goals <br/>such as completing assignments on 
	  time and making notes to pass my exams. 
	  <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp In Chapter 5 it speaks about time management, using your time wisely.It stated that you should not just make time for work but also
	  for play. There's a saying that goes all work and <br/>no play makes Jill(Jack) and dull girl(boy).It suggests that you ensure you make time to achieve your goals, 
	  to work and also to do things you enjoy. Yes, it is always good to work towards being successful and achieving all your goals, but it is also good to take a breather
      and enjoy life. Live life with no regrets. I believe I can apply this too to my school life, make time for work and make time for leisure. There is a saying that
      says there is a time and place for everything. So there is a time for work and there is a time for play.
      <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp In Capter 6 speaks about surrounding yourself with the best people.In this chapter it focused on having persons around you that are like
	  minded , who are ambitious, or even persons who are more successful than you are. When you surround yourself with people like these then you will be more motivated
	  to achieve your goals and also to reach for the stars.If you had surrounded yourself with time wasters you too will eventually start wasting time, you want to 
	  surround yourself with people that will push you to be a better version of yourself. I can appky this very well in my studies, netorkw with persons that are above
	  me so they can help me in areas I may fall short in.
